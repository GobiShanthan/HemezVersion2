#### Future Plans  
###### Our team's upcoming plans for the project include the immediate implementation of streaming real-time audio and video to enable our users to communicate more precisely with each other in real-time regardless of geographical location. We are also going to add the capability to exchange images with other users, and the option for users to add each other to customizable friend lists so that users can easily keep track of their online acquaintances.
